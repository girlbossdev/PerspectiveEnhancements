# Perspective Enhancements

Adds a settings page under Options > Controls that allows you to configure the behavior of the perspective key.

## Features
- **Toggle/Hold functionality**: In addition to cycling through perspectives, you can hold down the key to switch to the next perspective and switch back upon releasing it. Default threshold is 250 ms, and can be changed.
- **Perspective customization**: You can disable the front or back perspective (or both, if you really want to), and change the default perspective.
